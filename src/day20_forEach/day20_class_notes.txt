Java Programming Day20

Topics: String Methods
		Arrays Utility
		For Each Loop

package name: day20_forEach

warmup tasks:
	1. write a program that can multiply each odd number of an integer array by 2
		            ex: 
		            	array = [1,2,3,4,5];

	                output: 
	                	array =[2,2,6,4,10]

	2. write a program that can merge two arrays of integers
	        Ex:
	            arr1 = {1,2,3,4}
	            arr2 = {5,6}
	            
	        output
	            arr3 = {1,2,3,4,5,6}


	3. Write a program that can reverse an array of integers and returns it as new array
	        ex:
	            array = {1,2,3,4,5};

	        output:
	            reversedArray = {5,4,3,2,1};




String Methods:
	toCharArray(): returns char array
	split(CharSequence): returns String array
