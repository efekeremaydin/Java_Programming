1. Create a class named MedianNumber. write a program that can find the median number between three DIFFERENT given integers
		
		Ex:
                a = 10, b= 15, c = 20;

            Output:
                15 is the median number


2. Create a  class named NumberToWord, and write a Java program that can convert numbers between 0 ~ 9 into words

3. Create a class called Calculator; given two double variables named n1 & n2, and a char variable named mathOperator, write a program that can calculate the result of n1&n2 based on the given math Operator.

		char operator -> -, +, *, /

		when operator is + : add num1, num2
		when operator: - : minus num1, num2
		when operator: * : multiply num1, num2
		when operator: / : divide num1, num2
		for any other operators: print "invalid operator"

		Ex:
			n1 = 10, n2= 20, mathOperator = '+'

		output:
			30

	                    Old Senior Citizen (85+)

            Note: Do not use more than one print statement


7. Create a class named EqualNumbers, and write a program that can check the equality of the three given numbers
	 			declare 3 numbers n1, n2, n3
	 			if all are equal ==> print "all equal"
	  			if only n1 and n2 are equal  =>print  "n1&n2 are equal"
	   			if only n2 and n3 are equal ==>print "n2&n3 are equal"
	   			if only n3 and n1 are qual ==>print "n3&n1 are equal"
				if none of them are equal ==> none of them are equal



8. Create a class named OxygenTank. You are diving in the ocean. Your oxygen tank has a certain level (number) and you must print a message based on the level:
                Above 90 -  Your tank is full
                Above 80 -  Still okay
                Above 70 -  Don't go too far
