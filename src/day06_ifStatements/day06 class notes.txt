Package name: day06_ifStatements

Warmup task:
	1. Create a class named OddOrEven, and write a program that can identify if the given number is odd or even
			Ex:
				number = 20

			output:
				20 is an even number: true
				20 is an odd number: false

		Hint: even numbers are the numbers that are evenly divisible by 2 (the remainder is zero)


	2. Create a class named IdentifyNumber, and write a program that can identify if the given number is positive, or negative or zero. 

			Ex:
				number = 200

			output:
		        200 is positive number: true
		        200 is negative number: false
		        200 is zero: false

    3. Create a class named EvenlyDivisible, and write a program that can check if a number is evenly divisible by 2, 3, 5        
            Ex:
                number = 65;

            output:
                65 is divisible by 2: false
                65 is divisible by 3: false
                65 is divisible by 5: true

            Evenly Divisible ==> remainder is zero



Single If Statement: can be used for creating condition for one possible output
