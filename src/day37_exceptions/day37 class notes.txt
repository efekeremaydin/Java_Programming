Exceptions Topics:
	1. Exceptions Intro
// unwanted or unexpected events

// when the exception obj passed to the catch block it will be assigned to a ref var
// in the try block there's no ref var that will ref to the exception obj
// if try block handles the exception then exception obj will be collected by garbage coll
// if try block can't handle then exception will be passed to the catch block and assigned to the ref var
// through the ref var we can call printStackTrace() and getMessage() methods (they are m from RuntimeException class)

final vs finalize vs finally:

	final: keyword ==> unchangable

	finalize: method ===> GC use it to collect the objects that are eligible for garbage collection

	finally: block ===> can only used with try&catch
