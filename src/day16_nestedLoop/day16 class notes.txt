	Nested Loop

package name: day16_nestedLoop

Warmup tasks:
	1. Create a class named CydeoLogIn. you are writing a code for the log-in function of the Cydeo Application, assume that your credentials are:
                    username: Cydeo
                    password: WoodenSpoon

        Ask the user to enter their credentials. 
                If credentials are matched, your program should print "Logged in." 
                
                If the credentials are not matched, the program should allow
                the user to have three attempts to enter correct credentials

                if all three attempts are failed, then print "Your account is lucked."


        2. write a program that can return the frequency of a character from a string
        	Ex:
        		str = "aaabbbbccccc"
        		ch = 'c'

		     output:
		     	5

	3.  Write a program that can return the frequency of the word java from a sentence

		    output:
		        4



  "xxyyyzzz"

	1. Write a program for a simple calculator
			1.1 ask the user to enter first number: (double)
			1.2 ask the user to enter a math operator: (-, +, *, /)
				if the user enters invalid math operator, reapet the same step until user enters a valid operator

			1.3 ask the to enter the second number: (double)
			1.4 display the calculation result
			1.5 Would you like to continue? (Yes/No)



	2. FrequencyOfCharacters:
			"AAABBCCCCDDDDD"
