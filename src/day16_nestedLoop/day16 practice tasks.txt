                        output:
                                a2b1c3d1

10. Write a program that can find the unique characters from a string without using index() and lastIndexOf() methods

                        Ex:
                        str = "aabccdeef";

                        output:
                                bdf

            Hint: if you find out how to find the frequency of one character, then you can repeat it for the remaining characters to find the frequency.
                        if frequency of a character == 1  =========> unique
