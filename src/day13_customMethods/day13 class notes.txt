Package name: day13_customMethods

Warmup task:
	1. Create a method named calculate that can take three arguments:
            num1 (double)
            num2 (double)
            mathOperator (char)

	    The method should display the calculation result of those two numbers as long as the 3rd argument is a valid math operator, otherwise the method prints "Invalid Operator"

	        Ex:
	            calculate(10, 20, '+')

	        output:
	            10 + 20 = 30


	2. Create a method named ageGroup that can print the age group of the person

	        age groups are:
	                Teenager (< 21)
	                Adult   (>=21 && <55 )    
	                Senior  ( > 55 )


    3. Create a method named eligibleToVote that takes two arguments:
	        1. age (int)
	        2. isAmerican (boolean)

	    Then the method should determine if the person eligible to vote
	        Ex:
	            eligibleToVote(23, true)

	        output:
	            You are eligible to vote

											MUST         MUST
		Access-Modifier   Specifier    Return-type    methodName(Parameter){

				Code fragments

		}


		Access Modifiers: public, protected, deafult, private

							public: ALWAYS ACCESSBILE


		Specifiers: static, final, abstract, synchronized

					static: can be called through the class name


		Return-type: void, Any dataType

					void: does not return any value
					Any dataType: must return a vlaue


		MethodName: meaningful, descriptive

		Parameters: Any Data Type


		MUST be declared inside the class and outside any other blocks/methods



Return statement: used for exiting (terminating) the current mothod
			we can also use it for returning value from return methods
