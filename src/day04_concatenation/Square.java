5. Create a class named Square and declare the following variables:
                side
                area
                perimeter

    5.1 Write a program that can calculate the area and perimeter of a square with any given  side
        Ex:
              side = 5

        output:
               The area of the square is 25
               The perimeter of the square is 20
