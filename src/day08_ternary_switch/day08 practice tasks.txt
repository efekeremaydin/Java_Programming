                USE ONE PRINT STATEMENT ONLY

            Solution 1: Must use ternary


5. Create a class called ChooseLanguage, 
 		Given an integer variable named selection that has a number between 1~5.
 		Write a program that can select the language based on the number that's given in the selection and print the following message:

			for 1: Hello, thank you for your call
			for 2: Hola, gracias para llamar
			for 3: Merhaba, aradiginiz icin tesekkurler
			for 4: Privet, spasibo za vash zvonok
			for 5: Merci ,pour votre appel

			for any other numbers print "Invalid Number"

		Solution 1: Must use ternary
		Solution 2: MUST use the switch statement


6. Create a class called BiggerNum, and write a program that checks for the bigger of 3 numbers.

        you get 3 int variables with DIFFERENT values: n1, n2 and n3

            if n1 is biggest output: "n1 is bigger"
            if n2 is biggest output: "n2 is bigger"
            if n3 is biggest output: "n3 is bigger"

         NOTE: MUST USE TERNARY


7. Create a class called Calculator; given two double variables named n1 & n2, and a char variable named mathOperator, write a program that can calculate the result of n1&n2 based on the given math Operator.

		char operator -> -, +, *, /

		when operator is + : add num1, num2
		when operator: - : minus num1, num2
		when operator: * : multiply num1, num2
		when operator: / : divide num1, num2
		for any other operators: print "invalid operator"

		Ex:
			n1 = 10, n2= 20, mathOperator = '+'

		output:
			30

		Note: MUST use the switch statement


8. HTTP is the protocol that governs communications between web servers and web clients. 
Part of the protocol includes a status code returned by the server to tell the browser the status of its most recent page request. 
    Some of the codes and their meanings are listed below:

            status codes and their meanings: 
	                200, OK
	                201, Created
	                202, Accepted
	                301, Moved Permanently
	                303, See Other
	                304, Not Modified
	                307, Temporary Redirect
	                400, Bad Request
	                401, Unauthorized
	                403, Forbidden
	                404, Not Found
	                410, Gone
	                500, Internal Server Error
	                503, Service Unavailable

 
         declare an int variable called statusCode, and a valid status code is already given
         write a program that prints out, on a line by itself, the appropriate label from the above list based on status.

                    Example:
                        if status code = 200

                    output:
                        ok

        Solution 1: Must use ternary
		Solution 2:	MUST use the switch statement


9. write a program that can display the selected browser
            3.1  declare a String variable called browserName
            3.2  Assume that the valid browsers are: chrome, firefox, opera, safari, edge
            3.3 if the browser name does not match with the valid browsers' names, the output should be: Invalid Browser

        	Do Not use if statement or ternary


10. Create a class named CydeoBatches. In Cydeo, we have three batch types: US morning, US evening, and EU.
        Depending on a batch type (String) print information about the batch. 

        	If batch type is US morning ==> print "Class times are 10-5 EST. M, T, Th, F."
        	If batch type is US evening ==> print "Class times are 7-10 EST. M, T, W, Th, S, S"
        	If batch type is EU ==> print "Class times are  10-5 EST. M, T, W, Th, F."
        	If the batch type is invalid, print "Invalid Btach"

        	Note:
			 	Solution 1: use if statement
				Solution 2: use the switch statement
				Solution 2: use if & switch statements mixed
