Warmup tasks:
	1. Create a class called SalaryCalculator.java
			1.1declare the following variables:
					hourlyRate, weeklyHours, stateTaxRate, federalTaxRate

			1.2 use the given info in the above variables to calculate the following:
					1. salaryBeforeTax
					2. stateTax
					3. federalTax
					4. totalTax
					5. salaryAfterTax
				Hint: salaryBeforeTax = hourlyRate * weeklyHour * 52
				
			1.3 use the print statement to print each of the above
					Ex:	   hourlyRate = $50 
						   weeklyHours = 45
						   stateTaxRate = 6 (given as a percentage, you need to convert to decimal)
						   federalTaxRate = 26 (given as a percentage, you need to convert to decimal)

					    output:
					    	Gross pay is: $117000
					    	Federal tax is: $30420 
				    		State tax is: $7020
				    		Total tax is: $37440
				    		Net income is: 79560
