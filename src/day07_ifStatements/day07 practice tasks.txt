1. Create a class called  CappuccinoBuyer. A variable named Size is given, write a program that can display the price and calories of cappuccino

			Valid sizes are tall, grande, and venti and their price & calories are:

						tall: 
								price is $3.69
								90 calories

						grande:
								price is $3.99;
								120 calories

						venti:
								price is $4.29
								150 calories

			If the size is invalid then the output should be "Invalid Size"

			Note: MUST use nested if


2. Create a class called Browser. Write a program that can display the name of the selected browser
        1. declare a String variable named browserName
        2. Assume that the valid browsers are chrome, firefox, opera, safari, and edge.
        3. if the browser name does not match with the valid browser names, output should be: Invalid Browser Name

        Ex:
            String browser = "chrome";

        Output:
            Chrome Browser is selected

        Note: MUST use nested if

3. Create a class called CrewAndPassenger; given the number of people on the ship (int number), determine how many need to be crew members and how many can be passengers. Print how many of each type there should be.
    
            Total: 50  ====> 20 crew, 30 passengers
            Total: 75  ====> 25 crew, 50 passengers
            Total: 100 ====> 30 crew, 70 passengers 
            Any other number of people on the ship is not valid 

            NOTE: MUST USE NESTED IF. DO NOT USE MORE THAN ONE PRINT STATEMENT


4. Create a class called Grade, and a char variable named Grade is given. write a program to print the following messages:
            'A': excellent
            'B': great job
            'C': good
            'D': passed
            'F': failed
            Otherwise: invalid

            NOTE: MUST USE NESTED IF. DO NOT USE MORE THAN ONE PRINT STATEMENT

5. Create a class called AgeGroups, and write a program that can define the age groups of a person
            age groups are:
                    Teenager (< 21)
                    Adult   (>=21 && <55 )    
                    Senior  ( > 55 )

             if the age is negative or greater than 150, print "invalid"

             NOTE: MUST USE NESTED IF. DO NOT USE MORE THAN ONE PRINT STATEMENT


6. Create a class called FINRA; write a function that prints out the number. but for a number which is a multiple of 3, print "FIN" instead of the number, and for a number which is a multiple of 5, print "RA" instead of the number. and for a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "FINRA" instead of the number.
            ex:
                number = 3

                output:
                      FIN


                number = 10

	            output:
	                RA


            	number = 15

	            output:
	                FINRA

7. Create a class called GradeLevel; given a number(byte) grade level, determine and print which school type someone is in.
            grade level and types are:
                    1-5: Elementary school

                    13-16: College
                    17-18: Grad School
                    
                    For Any Other grade: Invalid grade level given

            NOTE: MUST USE NESTED IF. DO NOT USE MORE THAN ONE PRINT STATEMENT
