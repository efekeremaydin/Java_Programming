Warmup Tasks:
    1. Create a class named LoanApplication. two variables named salary and createdScore are declared and given, write a program that can check if the person is eligible to apply for a loan
            Note: In order to be eligible for a loan:
                    1. salary: at least 45K
                    2. credit score: at least 700


	2. Create a class named Grade, and a char variable named grade is given. write a program to print the following messages:
            'A': Excellent
            'B': Great job
            'C': Good
            'D': Passed
            'F': Failed

        Note: Do not use more than one print statement
        

    3. Create a class named NetIncomeCalc, Write a program that can calculate the salary after tax based on the following requirements
                the tax rates are:
                        35% for salary of 130K or more
                        30% for salary of 100K to 129k
                        25% for salary of 80K to 99K
                        20% for salary of 79K or less

                in addition:
                	if the person is married, he/she will pay 5% less tax

Single if: for one condition

If & Else: when there are TWO (not more, not less than 2) options/possibilities/alternatives we need to create the condition for
            
            for 2 conditions


Multi-branch If: when there are three more options/possibilities/alternatives we need to create conditions for
            
            for three or more conditions
        
        if(Conidition1){
            StatementA
        }esle if(Conidtion2){
            StatementB
        }else if(Conidition3){
            StatementC
        }else{
            StatementD
        }


        ONLY one block gets executed

        StatementA: Condition1 is true

        StatementB: Condition1 MUST be false, ondition2 is true

        StatementC: Condition1 & Condition2 MUST be false, condtion3 is true

        StatementD: Condition1 & Condition2 & Condition3 must be false


Nested If: for pre-conditions 


If statement without curly braces: 
            without the curly braces the blocks of the if statement can only have one statement in their body
