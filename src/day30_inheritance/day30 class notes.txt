Warmup tasks:
	1. Create a named Phone:
				Variables:
					brand, model, size, price, color

				Encapsulate all the fields
					Conditions:
						1. price can not be zero or negative
						2. color can only be set to:
								{"Black", "White", "Silver", "Gold", "Pink"}

				Add a constructor that can set all the fields 

				Methods:
					call(long phoneNumber)
					text(long phoneNumber)
					toString()

	2. Create the following sub classes of Phone:

			2.1 Iphone:
					Extra methods:
						faceTime(phoneNumber)
						faceTile(email)

			2.2 Samsung:
					Extra methods:
						freeze()

			2.3 Nokia:
					Extra methods:
						selfDefense()



OOP Inheritance: to build IS A relationship between the classes (parent/child,  super/sub)
				
				easiest way to get rich ===> extends

				Child class (sub): can inherit all the variables & methods that are accessible/visible from the parent class

				Parent class (super): can NOT inherit anything from child class. contains all the common features (variables/methods) of all child classes

				Class A extends Class B

				Advantages:
					less codes
					improves the reusability
					clean
					less memory usage
					easy to maintain


				One class can ONLY extend one class
				One class can be extended by MULTIPLE classes
